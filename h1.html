    <h1>ALL ABOUT MATHMATICAL GAMES</h1>
   
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Engaging mathematical games can also encourage students to explore number combinations, place value, patterns, and other important mathematical concepts. Playing games encourages strategic mathematical thinking as students find different strategies for solving problems and deepen their understanding of numbers.Mathematics is a subject that is absolutely necessary for functioning adequately in society. More than that, mathematics is a subject that should be more enjoyable than it sometimes is. The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) has identified the appreciation and enjoyment of mathematics as one of the national goals for mathematics education. This goal, coupled with the task of nurturing children’s confidence in their ability to apply their mathematical knowledge to solve real-life problems, is a challenge facing every parent today.

    <h2>4 Reasons to Promote Math Success through Games</h2>

    <h3>1.Mind-Body Connection</h3>
    <p>
        One of the main benefits of playing math games is in the amount of retention it creates. A lot of teachers use basic forms of TPR (Total Physical Response) like moving your arms or waving hands to help with learning, but many forget that getting kids all the way up and active sparks a connection in the neurons of the brain to help with processing and retention of new information.

        A game called Hop to It has been one of my favorite tools for my kids struggling with basic number sense, and it also actively challenges my advanced-level students. They have to move to the corresponding numbers related to a set question and be aware of how they physically move to get there, such as on one foot or with their left hand.

        The physical connection to what the brain needs to know to make the number decision is instant and long lasting, while the laughter and discussions they have well after game time ends also create a lingering learning effect that lends to all student levels feeling equal and challenged to complete the tasks.
    </p>
    <h3>2.Reaching Students At All Levels</h3>
    <p>
        Many of the teachers I speak with are noticing an increase in the numbers of students who need extra help, as well as a wider gap between the kids who easily understand the math concepts and those who don’t.

        Other educators who are noticing this disturbing trend can investigate math games as an effective strategy for closing the gap. Look for the types of games, especially in software games, that are truly personalized to each individual students’ learning path. This way, students can make meaningful gains in learning, without always having to be in groups leveled by ability.

        Within the ability-leveled groups, many kids simply shut down when they are repeatedly placed in the low groups; they have little desire to continue to work hard when they feel they are always behind the others in class. Generate a game environment that fosters the constant connections minus the feelings of segregation.

    </p>
    <h3>3.Professional Growth for Educators</h3>
    <p>
        Setting up a game-based learning environment does take organization and planning. It also takes the ability to step back and be able to handle the failures as well as the successes. The learning curve of teachers shouldn’t stop at the doors of, “I understand and can confidently teach this content.” The learning curve needs to be constant and forever developing.

        Our students depend on us to continue to strive toward using the best methods for the current population of students while improving on the methods we hold in our toolboxes.

        If we are going to ask our students to continue to step out of their comfort level and challenge their personal learning curves, we owe it to them to continue to do the same.
    </p>
    <h3>4.Developing a Love for Math</h3>
    <p>
        The resounding claim by my students is how much they LOVE the chance to be outside, active and learning all at the same time. It is often forgotten, in the hustle and bustle of meeting all the benchmarks, testing deadlines and chaos of the daily grind in teaching math, that it still has to be fun.

        Yes, FUN! We’ve come back full circle to the beginning. Kids respond to learning when engaged, challenged and enjoying their tasks.

    <h2>Benefits of Playing maths game</h2>
    <p>Maths activities could give your child’s learning a boost in many ways, and help them engage with numbers (and enjoy it!) from a young age. Lucy Dimbylow offers 12 reasons to give number puzzles a go today.</p>
    <p>
    <ul style="color:rgb(161, 88, 209); font-size: large;">
        <li>Number puzzles help make maths enjoyable</li>
        <li>They take away the fear</li>
        <li>They help your child grasp diverse mathematical concepts</li>
        <li>They build fluency</li>
        <li>Number puzzles help develop strategic thinking</li>
        <li>They allow children to work at their own level</li>
        <li>They improve learning</li>
        <li>They teach transferable skills</li>
        <li>They boost spatial skills</li>
        <li>They increase your child’s future earning power</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>
    Thinking of the game as a part of a bigger educational process is really in the core mind-set that this project wants to promote. Games can do many things very well, but they certainly cannot do everything at once. Especially not without solid supporting structures around them. Throughout the project and the case studies we built this was true. As each teacher build her or his story these processes were discussed and reflected upon and we will be referring to these and link back to them.

    This project aimed as much at using alternative and innovative methods to teach through coding digital games and playing games as part of learning, as at developing the skills of teachers in extending academic goals to understand, support and include the whole child: not only their academic subject skills but also social, emotional and behavioural skills.

    Some key factors have been identified which have enabled the teachers at the schools we saw to take steps towards better embedding games into their lessons. Many of these factors have been highlighted as the factors needed to bring about teacher change.
